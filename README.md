🔍 Data acts as a lens that we can leverage to **unravel the world’s complexity**, turning what might seem chaotic and convoluted into something much more structured and transparent.

✍️ **Self-reported data** serves the same purpose, yet shifts the focus inward, explaining facts with personal narratives that reveal who we are and the stories we carry within.

🌟 In this context, data visualization becomes a tool for **self-discovery**, helping us see patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. 

🫐 Inspired by the concept of [Data Humanism](https://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold), this project explores the potential of small, subjective data. Over the past year (2024), I’ve been collecting data about my daily life that I found interesting –partly to better understand myself, reflect on the year once the collection is complete, and experiment with a new project without rigid goals. Working with personal data had been on my to-do list for some time, and I’m glad I finally took the plunge.

🧶 The **daily practice** of tracking data has been a valuable discovery itself: I practiced consistency, realized it works best when I focus on only a few features, resisted the urge to introduce changes to keep the collection simple and coherent,  cursed myself when I forgot one or more days, and felt the satisfaction of steady progress. 

🫧 Some of my initial research questions include:
- How do emotions change throughout the year, across months, days, or weekends?
- What are my favorite days and seasons, and how do these relate to mood? 
- How does physical location or activities like watching movies influence my emotional state?
- Are there surprising cross-influences, like certain days correlating with specific movies or moods?
