🔍 Data is a lens through which we shape and interpret reality, bringing clarity to complex phenomena.

✍️ Self-reported data shares the same goal, yet shifts the focus, from the external world to our inner reality, revealing a narrative of who we are and the story we carry within.

🌟 In this context, data visualization becomes a powerful tool for self-discovery, helping us see patterns that might otherwise remain hidden.

🫐 Inspired by the concept of Data Humanism, this project explores the potential of small, subjective data. Over the past year, on a daily basis, I have been collecting data on a few key indicators, without a predefined goal, just out of curiosity, to experiment and see where it might lead.

🧶 The daily practice of tracking data has been a valuable discovery itself: I practiced consistency, learned that this consistency works best when I track only a few indicators, resisted the urge to introduce changes to keep the collection simple and coherent, cursed myself when I forgot one or more days, and felt the satisfaction of steady progress. With each small step, I discovered the true impact of the journey, which is only visible in hindsight.

🫧 Some relationships I aim to explore—my personal research questions—include:
- How do I feel throughout the year? Is there a correlation between my emotions and months, days, or weekends?
- Are my emotions influenced by my physical location? For example, how does going to the office affect my mood?
- Is there a connection between watching movies and my emotional state?
- How do I feel on days when I have a headache?
- What about cross-influences? For instance, do specific days of the year correlate with movies, or do cities and movies affect each other?
