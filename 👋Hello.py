    â†’ This year I am finally succeeding in collecting various personal data from everyday life (emotions, where I am, the movies I see,
    and some others) â€“after a few failed attempts. Since last year, I've realized that in order to be consistent 
    in daily data collection, I cannot gather data of too many diverse topics (if the goal is annual). 
    So to begin with, I am focusing on what I am most interested in: {str(annotation("daily emotions", "", "#faa"))} and
    what can influence them!

    [Data Humanism](https://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold), data moves from being
