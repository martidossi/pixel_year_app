    üîç Data is a lens through which we shape and interpret reality,
    bringing clarity to complex phenomena.
    
    Self-reported data shares the same goal, yet shifts the focus,
    from the external world to our inner reality,
    revealing a narrative of who we are and the story we carry within.
    
    In this context, data visualization becomes a powerful tool for self-discovery,
    helping us see patterns that might otherwise remain hidden.
    
    Inspired by the concept of [Data Humanism](https://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold),
    this project explores the potential of small, subjective data.
    Over the past year, on a daily basis, I have been collecting data on a few key indicators,
    without a predefined goal, just out of curiosity, to experiment and see where it might lead.
    
    The daily practice of tracking data has been a valuable discovery itself:
    I practiced consistency, learned that this consistency works best
    when I track only a few indicators, resisted the urge to introduce changes
    to keep the collection simple and coherent, cursed myself when I forgot one or more days,
    and felt the satisfaction of steady progress. With each small step, I discovered the true
    impact of the journey, which is only
    visible in hindsight.

    - Is there a connection between watching movies and my emotional state?
    - How do I feel on days when I have a headache?
    - What about cross-influences? For instance, do specific days of the year correlate with movies, or do cities and movies affect each other?
